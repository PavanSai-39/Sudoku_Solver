# Sudoku Solver

Sudoku is a popular logic-based puzzle game. The game consists of a grid typically divided into a 9x9 square. The grid is further divided into nine 3x3 subgrids. The objective of Sudoku is to fill the grid with digits from 1 to 9, ensuring that each row, each column, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contains all of the digits from 1 to 9 **without repetition**. So here I've developed a backtracking algorithm capable of efficiently solving Sudoku puzzles.

Below is a  short recording of the sudoku solver.
